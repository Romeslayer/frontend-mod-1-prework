## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
- My workflow felt more or less the same, since I didn't have much time to work on the prework before leaving.
I only had two sessions where I implemented the Pomodoro technique and I feel like its surprisingly close to how I generally focus on an activity, I set my timer for 30 minutes and got to working.  

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
- I had set my intentions for my first sessions as to finish the section 4 work in that session, I had blocked off the whole day but I was not as focused as I felt I could have been because my intention was a little too vague. The second session I had wrote exactly what exercises I needed to work on and what my overall goal was at the end and I feel like I that was the change I needed to do within the Pomodoro technique.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
- An object is a complex data type that can store any data type. You can access the data within objects by using it's key-value pairs. The key is the name that is used to access the value that is attached. Objects can also have functions attached to them -called methods, and you can use methods to change the data stored within the object.  
- The main difference between an object and array is that an array cannot have methods.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
   - An array would be better here. Arrays are best when the list of data is all the same and since it's just the students names theres no need to have an object.
  * List of states and their capitals
   - An object would work best here since you have 50 different states with their *own* city. Since there is ownership between the state and city it makes since to group them and you can easily do so with an object.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  - An array, it would be confusing to use an object in this instance, what would the key's name be?
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  - If it's just the names that you are listing then an array would be best.
  * List of student names and their cohort
  - Since the students could be in different cohorts, then an object would be best to use here, you can have the student and their cohort grouped together.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  - An object would work best here, you need to know what ingredients and the amount of each, it would be too difficult to group those items without using an object.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  - An array would be best here, since all the data will be the same you can easily place it all in an array.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
 - I think that profiles in many websites are probably stored as an object with methods that can be used to change the name, address and any other content that are attached to the profiles.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
Why don't we separate the different methods with a comma?
