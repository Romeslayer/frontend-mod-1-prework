## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  - The tenant of a Growth Mindset that I know works well for me is striking to improve within one's zone of proximal development. One way I can relate to it is that I love to rollerblade and I have mastered a fair amount of skills by starting with the basics and slowly progressing through each 'progression' for lack of a better word. A concept that is new to me is the acronym S.M.A.R.T.: Setting specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound goals. I feel like its easy enough to remember to encorporate into my studies.
1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  - I believe that I mostly hold a Growth Mindset, one thing that I could work on is seeking out challenges more often, I like to learn and I find it easy, but will shy away from challenging myself.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
  - I believe that an Array would be used for Facebook to hold a list of Friends, or even the hyperlinks to their individual pages.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
 - An Array method is like a function that are innate to the array object. The methods are used to manipulate or divulge
 array items.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
The purpose of a loop is to do a task over the items of an array multiple times without having to
code it out for every item. We would use a loop in conjunction to an array to make the same changes
to the items of the array. We would use a loop without an array when we know how many times we need to loop.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
Looping is when you make the computer do the same task over and over again. You
can choose to make it loop 1 or 100 times it doesn't matter, as long as you tell it to.
Say you want 100 ice cream scoops on your cone, you would tell the computer how many
scoops you have on the cone, then make it check if there is 100 scoops, if not add a scoop
and repeat to check how many scoops there are on and add one again until its 100. Then enjoy!

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
  - Is there methods that change text in an array or do we have to loop through?
