## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
  * I felt like the SuperLearner Article was a good refresher on some healthy habits that I have lost since being out of school. I already read a lot, mostly politics and I am a proponent of taking lots of breaks. I could work on developing a growth mindset and teaching others what I know. I _tend_ to hold back in a group setting even if I know the answer.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
  * The data type that I learned about are __strings__, __numbers__, and __booleans__.
    * __Strings__ can be a single word or a paragraph. The value of the string must be wrapped in quotation marks and can be either single or double marks as long as you encapsulate the value with the same marks. EX `var str = 'words and more words'`
    * __numbers__ are the number form of a number. For the value to truly be a number it cannot have quotation marks or commas, it must be a number. EX `var num = 0;`
    * __boolean__ data type is a binary that holds `true` or `false`. Pro tip: booleans don't use quotation marks. EX `var bool = true;`
3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
  * You can log the string with `console.log('"Hello World!"')`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
  * The characters to use to comment are two forward slashes `//`, comments are used to add context to the code, so a maintainer can understand the logic behind the code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
  * A variable is a container that can hold different data types. A variable is like a box, but this box has a special rule that if you place a object in there it can only hold that kind of object. Like if we were to put a toy in the box then the box is a toy box that can only hold other toys, but we can take all the toys out replace it with soap, now the box is a soapbox that can only hold soap.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold? A site that I use frequently would be Youtube. Some variables that I presume youtube would use is one for the username and password that I created and those would be a string. Another variable would be the amount of videos a user has uploaded which would be a number.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
  * Concatenation is when you combine two strings using `+` outside of two strings to combine them to make one string.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
  * A site that I am sure uses concatenation would be any news sites. The developers would use concatenation to combine multiple strings to make the whole article.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
  * What use case is there for using concatenation over interpolation? I feel like using interpolation so much easier to type.
